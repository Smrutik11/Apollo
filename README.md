# Apollo
Objective:
The objective of the Apollo Database Management System is to create a simple, interactive, command-line tool to manage a library of books. This tool allows users to perform basic database operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records of books.

Project Overview:
The Apollo Database Management System is designed using Python for scripting and MySQL for the database. It features a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to manage book records with ease. The system ensures that all book data is stored persistently in a MySQL database and provides functionalities to add, view, update, and delete book records.

Key Components and Implementation
1. Database Setup:
MySQL: A relational database management system used to store book records.
Schema Design: The database contains a single table named books with columns for id, title, author, and year.
2. Python Script:
The Python script interacts with the MySQL database to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and provides a CLI for user interaction.
